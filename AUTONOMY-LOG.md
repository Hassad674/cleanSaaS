# AUTONOMY-LOG — Autonomous upgrade of CleanSaaS

> **This file is the single source of truth for the autonomous upgrade session.**
> It survives context compaction. If you (the agent) just woke up / were compacted:
> 1. Read this whole file.
> 2. Run `git branch --show-current` and `git log --oneline -15`.
> 3. Run `cd backend && go build ./... && go test ./...` and `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run` to confirm green.
> 4. Resume from the first `[ ]` or `[~]` item in the current phase below.

## Mission

Elevate CleanSaaS from "very good boilerplate" to genuinely world-class, matching the bar set by the
owner's best project (DesignedTrust-Services). Backend is the priority; frontend only needs good demo UX.
The real product = the **enforcement system** (CLAUDE.md + memory + skills + CI + hooks) that forces
AI-generated code to stay maintainable/performant/secure, usable by beginners AND pros.

## Standing decisions (do not re-litigate)

- **Autonomy scope:** MAXIMUM — including behavior-changing backend P0 + targeted DDD. Owner reviews diff on return.
- **Remove referral + mobile:** YES, both. referral via `/remove-feature` logic; mobile = delete folder. Reversible via git.
- **Delivery:** stacked git branches, one per phase, atomic conventional commits. **DO NOT push** (no auth; owner pushes after review).
- **Verification gate:** nothing is `[x]` until it passes `go build`, `go test`, `tsc`, `vitest` (and Playwright when relevant). Keep the app runnable.
- **DDD verdict:** PARTIAL — rich aggregates for billing + team only; value objects broadly (Email/Money/Slug); skip aggregate ceremony for simple CRUD (blog/notification/storage/user).
- **Language:** respond to owner in French; code/comments/docs in English.

## Branch plan (stacked — each branches off the previous phase tip)

| Phase | Branch | Base |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `phase-0-calibration` | `main` |
| 1 | `phase-1-enforcement` | `phase-0-calibration` |
| 2 | `phase-2-hygiene` | `phase-1-enforcement` |
| 3 | `phase-3-backend-p0` | `phase-2-hygiene` |
| 4 | `phase-4-ddd` | `phase-3-backend-p0` |

## Current state

- **Active phase:** 3 — Backend P0 (5 of 7 items done; 2 + Phase 4 remain)
- **Active branch:** `phase-3-backend-p0`
- **Baseline:** GREEN throughout (every commit passed go build + go test + gofmt + gates; pre-commit hook active).
- **Phases 0,1,2 COMPLETE and committed.** Phase 3 in progress.
- **Last action:** committed transactions/UoW (9f222a8). Gates pass.

### Done in Phase 3 (each its own commit, verified green)
- config fail-closed validation + scheduler panic recovery (b5e5ea1)
- team IDOR fix (beb0a1d)
- Stripe webhook idempotency + retry-safety (8c4b1c3) + gofmt of 3 pre-existing files (8e1571d)
- atomic CreateTeam via DBTX + TxManager unit-of-work (9f222a8)
- JWT short access + rotating/revocable refresh tokens (46b92a2)
- context timeout/cancellation discipline (stripe honors ctx, job/external/DB timeouts) (fb82be6)

### REMAINING
Phase 3 (P0) leftovers:
- [ ] Optimistic locking (version column) on mutable aggregates + consistent RowsAffected checks.
- [ ] Extend the TxManager pattern to other multi-write flows (conversation+message; subscription+invoice).
Phase 4 (targeted DDD):
- [x] Value objects (Email/Money/PlanInterval) + rich billing Subscription aggregate + thin service (9609863)
- [ ] Rich team aggregate methods + domain events mechanism (DEFERRED — refinement; team authz works + is tested)
- [ ] testcontainers integration tests for postgres adapters (DEFERRED — needs Docker image pulls; CI e2e.yml already runs against a real PG service)
Phase 5 — vibe-codable-by-default calibration:
- [x] CLAUDE.md "Default operating procedure for EVERY request" (plain-English -> skill routing
      + non-negotiables) + README "Vibe coding" section (40b5185)

## Phase 6 — drive every compartment to A (user: "je veux que tout soit en A")
Sequential, verified-or-revert, 1 compartment = 1 commit. Flip to A only when build+test+gates green (+ live check where possible).
- [x] **RLS / multi-tenancy → A** (b521736): org-based tenancy, 3-layer isolation, Postgres RLS FORCE,
      app_user role + SET LOCAL ROLE + GUC, ADR 0006. Cross-tenant isolation test PASSES vs live DB.
      Stack reset + reseeded org-aware; login returns JWT with `org` claim. VERIFIED.
- [ ] Observability → A (OTel tracing + Prometheus metrics + /livez /readyz) — IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Integration tests → A (testcontainers / live-PG, gated by build tag)
- [ ] Scalability → A (Redis adapters: rate-limit, WS pub/sub, scheduler leader-election; add redis to compose)
- [ ] Perf → A (keyset pagination + cache hot reads)
- [ ] API → A (/v1 + response envelope + OpenAPI gen) — NOTE: envelope change ripples to frontend
- [ ] DDD → A (team aggregate + domain events) + extend TxManager
- [ ] Security finish → A (audit log, CSP, session_version, centralized validation)
Honest note: getting ALL of the above to verified-A in one session is not guaranteed; the heaviest
(distributed Redis scaling, /v1 envelope w/ frontend) may land as A- pending a verification pass.

### Earlier-tracked refinements (still valid)
- [ ] Optimistic locking + consistent RowsAffected checks
- [ ] Extend TxManager to conversation+message & subscription+invoice flows

### Push status
main is ff-merged locally through fb82be6 but NOT pushed: the gh token lacks `workflow`
scope (refuses to push .github/workflows/*). User must run: `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow`.

## Phase 0 — Calibration (CLAUDE.md + memory + skills) — PRIORITY, do first

Foundation. A well-calibrated agent produces correct code; everything downstream depends on this.

- [x] Establish green baseline (fixed `mockPaymentSvc.RetrieveCheckoutSession` missing method)
- [x] Create AUTONOMY-LOG.md + branch strategy
- [x] **Memory sanitation** — MEMORY.md rewritten (removed sudo/personal/language lines; added module map + env-gating, ports, seeded creds, architecture invariants, skills index); architecture.md corrected to reality (adapters gemini/postgres/r2/resend/stripe; all features listed).
- [x] **Fix existing skills** (8): stale paths removed (0 left); `test` skill rewritten (Vitest + Playwright, no Jest).
- [x] **Upgrade CLAUDE.md** (root + admin): broken refs fixed (BLOCKED.md, TACHES.md §0.3/§1.4); hard numeric limits added; runtime/observability section added; Next 16 not 15; Compact-instructions point at AUTONOMY-LOG.md; skills table updated with /run /debug /e2e /verify-independence; admin/CLAUDE.md testing section added.
- [x] **New skills:** `/run`, `/debug`, `/e2e`, `/verify-independence` created (frontmatter valid).
- [~] Commit + create phase-1 branch (in progress).

## Phase 1 — Mechanical enforcement (CI + hooks + gates)  — COMPLETE

The leap toward the bar. Mostly additive (no app behavior change). All self-verified locally.

- [x] golangci-lint config (`backend/.golangci.yml`) — maps hard limits to funlen/gocyclo/cyclop/nestif/revive + SQL-correctness linters (bodyclose/rowserrcheck/sqlclosecheck). (golangci not installed locally → not run here; runs in CI.)
- [x] GitHub Actions `ci.yml` — fast: backend (build/vet/golangci/test -race + coverage floor 50%), frontend (tsc/vitest/build), admin (tsc/build), gates job, `ci-gate` aggregate (`if: always()`), concurrency auto-cancel, `permissions: contents: read`. YAML validated.
- [x] GitHub Actions `e2e.yml` — label-gated `run-e2e` + push-to-main, Postgres 16 service, migrate+seed, backend+frontend boot, Playwright, artifact upload. YAML validated.
- [x] Custom gate scripts `scripts/ci/`: cross-feature-imports (backend app/adapter + domain purity + frontend features), migration-pairs, hardcoded-colors, file-length (>600, demos warn-only), forbidden-names (conservative). `run-all.sh` exits 0 on clean repo (5/5).
- [x] Meta-tests `scripts/ci/__tests__/` — 5/5 pass (inject violation → gate fails; clean → passes). Verified independently.
- [x] `.githooks/pre-commit` (zero-dep bash: secret-guard + gofmt + best-effort go vet/tsc, staged-only, degrades gracefully) + `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` + `scripts/test-pre-commit.sh` (7/7 pass). Hook INSTALLED in this clone (dogfooding).
- [x] Dependabot config (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — gomod/npm×2/actions, grouped, React/Next/Tailwind majors split.
- [~] Commit + create phase-2 branch (in progress).

## Phase 2 — Hygiene & modularity demo  — COMPLETE

- [x] Remove `referral` (backend slice + frontend feature + demo page + migration 009) — build+tests green = modularity proof (committed f9b3aae)
- [x] Remove `mobile/` folder entirely (committed f9b3aae)
- [x] Reconcile docs: FEATURES.md (referral/mobile marked removed; RN→neutral), README (dropped Flutter prereq + mobile/ from tree; added docs/.github/scripts). TACHES.md left in place but no longer referenced by CLAUDE.md (its stale §refs were already fixed in phase 0).
- [x] OSS files: SECURITY.md + CONTRIBUTING.md (agent), CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (by-reference to dodge content filter), CHANGELOG.md (Unreleased captures all work), `.claudeignore`, `.gitignore` tuning (BLOCKED-*.md, local memory, test artifacts).
- [x] `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (5 mermaid diagrams), `docs/adr/` (README + ADRs 0001–0005 incl. targeted-DDD and enforcement-as-product), `docs/ops.md` runbook (3 incident playbooks).
- [x] Bonus fixes: Playwright baseURL/port :3006→:3010; e2e login admin@cleansaas.com→.dev.
- [~] Commit + create phase-3 branch (in progress).

NOTE: the OSS-hygiene agent hit an API content filter mid-run (Contributor Covenant enumeration). SECURITY.md + CONTRIBUTING.md landed before the block; CODE_OF_CONDUCT/CHANGELOG/.claudeignore written by main thread instead.

## Phase 3 — Backend P0 correctness (behavior-changing)

- [ ] Real transactions: `DBTX` interface; repos accept it; wrap multi-write use cases (team+owner, subscription+invoice, conversation+message) in `WithTx`
- [ ] JWT: short access token + refresh token (DB-stored, rotation) + `session_version`/revocation; `iss`/`aud`; `config.Validate()` fails boot on weak/default secret in non-dev
- [ ] Stripe webhook idempotency (processed_events table, ON CONFLICT) + return 5xx on transient errors
- [ ] Context timeouts on DB queries + external calls; stop discarding ctx in Stripe adapter
- [ ] Fix IDOR: team.Get/GetTeamBySlug verify membership
- [ ] Panic recovery in job scheduler goroutines
- [ ] Optimistic locking (version column) on mutable aggregates + consistent RowsAffected checks
- [ ] Commit + create phase-4 branch.

## Phase 4 — Targeted DDD + integration tests

- [ ] Value objects: Email, Money/AmountCents, Slug, PlanInterval (with tests)
- [ ] Rich billing aggregate (Subscription.Activate/Renew/ChangePlan/Cancel — invariants on the aggregate)
- [ ] Rich team aggregate (Invite/RemoveMember/ChangeRole authorization matrix as domain methods)
- [ ] Domain events (collected on aggregate, dispatched post-commit) — also fixes fire-and-forget emails
- [ ] Thin out app/billing + app/team services accordingly
- [ ] Integration tests: testcontainers + `//go:build integration` for postgres adapters
- [ ] Commit. Done — summarize for owner.

## Blockers log

(none yet — use BLOCKED-<phase>.md for anything stuck after 3 attempts, and note it here)

## Decisions / discoveries during work

- 2026-06-22: Pre-existing baseline bug — `mockPaymentSvc` missing `RetrieveCheckoutSession` made `go test ./...` red. Fixed. (Evidence CI is needed.)
